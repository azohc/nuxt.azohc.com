    <hr />
    <p>
      newly minted front-end developer with a master's from harbour space
      university, I am passionate about crafting immersive web experiences
      through meticulous and precise design implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've immersed myself in the dynamic world of web development, nurturing a
      particular interest in the creative programming possibilities enabled by
      webgl and three.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      in this journey, I took the lead, working closely with a skilled designer
      and a fellow developer. from a budding idea, we embarked on a path of
      iterative development, culminating in a project that bears the hallmark of
      each team member's dedication and input.
    </p>
    <p>
      as I venture into a new phase of my career, I carry with me a resourceful
      and entrepreneurial spirit, honed through experiences that demanded
      initiative and independent problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      my approach to development is characterized by a commitment to open
      communication and teamwork, values that I hold dear in fostering
      environments where creativity can be translated sound technical solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      at my core, I'm an engineer with solid, yet ever-growing, understanding of
      the prevalent development frameworks in today's tech landscape. while I
      naturally gravitate towards technical challenges, I am not afraid to dip
      my toes into the design pool, bringing a practical and analytical approach
      to the creative process.
    </p>
    <p>
      looking forward, I am eager to contribute this blend of technical skill
      and creative zest to projects that resonate with my passion for building
      beautiful and modern user experiences.
